💡 𝗖# 𝐓𝐢𝐩 - 𝗨𝘀𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗳𝗲𝗿 𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 (𝗗𝗧𝗢𝘀)  
  
🔥 𝗖# 𝟵 introduced 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀, a new data type ideal for defining immutable data models. Like classes, 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 offer value semantics and unique features that make them well-suited for scenarios like 𝘿𝙏𝙊𝙨 or simple configurations.  
  
𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗗𝗧𝗢𝘀?  
  
🚀 𝘿𝙏𝙊𝙨 are data carriers that encapsulate data for transfer between different application layers. They hide internal data structures and implementation details, promoting loose coupling.  
  
𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗧𝗢𝘀?  
  
𝗥𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 excel at 𝘿𝙏𝙊 creation due to their:  
  
✅ 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙨 provide a clean syntax, making the data structure clear and easy to understand.  
  
✅ 𝗜𝗺𝗺𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 (𝗯𝘆 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁): 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙨 are immutable by default, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended modifications during transfer. You can still create mutable 𝗿𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗿𝗱𝘀 if required.  
  
✅ 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗠𝗲𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗱𝘀: 𝙍𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙧𝙙𝙨 automatically generate essential methods like equality comparison, ToString, and deconstruction, reducing boilerplate code for cleaner and more maintainable code.
